# Project-Null
We are going to develop a software for people to share reading notes. Specifically, users can upload PDF files to our software and easily take notes of a PDF file. After saving your notes, notes will be shared to friends you selected in the software. Friends in this software can take notes of a same file and also comment on other friends' notes. We can also find people that you know or do not know who is reading the same/similar book/pdf file as you do. You can send friend request to them. If you do not want to see someone's notes, you can set to ignore his/her notes. We may think of and add on more features later.
